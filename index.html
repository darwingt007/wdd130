        <p>Tarija is a small city in a small state with the same name, it is surrounded by mountains but set up on a
            valley making it a great place to live, downtown's architecture shows the colonial structures and buildings
            that are still in a really good condition and along to the countryside showing landscapes in similitude to
            italian villas. But with people that love the earth they stand on and are polite and friendly with each
            other and those that visit us. And this is one of the characteristics of this place, besides all the natural
            beauty in it, nationally this city is recognized for its people, their friendliness towards others.</p>
